'''Module performing a scan of Tripoli-4 output listing in order to only keep
relevant parts of it = results to be used for V&V or analysis or the run.

Summary
-------

* Quickly reads the results file
* Recognize beginning and end of results sections
* Get the required number of batchs
* Get the edition batch numbers (if exists)


Use of :mod:`~valjean.eponine.tripoli4.scan`
-----------------------------------------------

.. doctest:: scan
    :hide:

    >>> import os
    >>> work_dir = 'scan'
    >>> os.mkdir(work_dir)
    >>> with open(os.path.join(work_dir, 'spam.res'), 'w') as tmpfile:
    ...     print("BATCH 10\\n"
    ...           "initialization time (s): 7\\n"
    ...           " batch number : 10\\n"
    ...           "RESULTS ARE GIVEN FOR SOURCE INTENSITY : 1.000000e+00\\n"
    ...           "Edition after batch number : 10\\n"
    ...           "simulation time (s) : 1\\n"
    ...           "NORMAL COMPLETION",
    ...           file=tmpfile)

To use this module you need to create a :class:`Scanner` object giving at least
the path to the file you want to read. This file should be a Tripoli-4 output
containing at least the flags precised in :ref:`eponine-t4-scan-caveats`.

    >>> import os
    >>> from valjean.eponine.tripoli4.scan import Scanner
    >>> results = Scanner(os.path.join(work_dir, 'spam.res'))
    >>> results.normalend
    True
    >>> len(results)
    1
    >>> results.times['initialization_time']
    7

    The expected key of the :class:`Scanner` object is the batch number, not an
    index. If you have the index you need to obtain the corresponding batch
    number first.

    >>> 'simulation time' in results[10]  # batch number = 10
    True
    >>> 'simulation time' in results[-1]  # -1 can only be an index, like 0
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    KeyError: -1
    >>> 'simulation time' in results[results.batch_number(-1)]
    True

.. note::

   It will probably be better to directly load a test file...


.. _eponine-t4-scan-caveats:

Caveats
-------

Beginning and end of results sections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Important for the scan: results will be kept

* **from** "RESULTS ARE GIVEN"
* **to** an end flag available in the list ``Scanner.end_flags``.
  Possibilities are:

  * Default end flag is ``"simulation time"``;
  * For exploitation jobs use ``"exploitation time"`` (example: Green bands);
  * for jobs running in parallel, ``"elapsed time"`` will also appear, after
    ``"simulation time"`` normal.

    There are no class variables, but instance variables (initialized when
    the object is built or when the file is read). They are directly accessible
    from the object. Main results are accessible directly from the
    :obj:`Scanner` object.

    **Instance variables:**

    `fname` (:class:`str`)
        name of the file that will be scanned

    `batches` (:class:`dict`)
        keep the number of batches and the packet_length
        (read from file `fname`)

    `normalend` (:class:`bool`)
        presence of "NORMAL COMPLETION"

    `end_flags` (:class:`list` (:class:`str`))
        possible end flags to stop the saving of results

    `para` (:class:`bool`)
        `True` in parallel mode

    `countwarnings` (:class:`int`)
        count number of warnings (for statistics)

    `counterrors` (:class:`int`)
        count number of errors (for statistics)

    `times` (:class:`collections.OrderedDict`)
        save times (initialization, simulation, exploitation and elapsed if
        exists). Mandatory ones are ``'initialization time'`` and ``'simulation
        time'`` or ``'exploitation time'``. ``'elapsed time'`` only appears in
        listings from parallel jobs.

    `last_generator_state` (:class:`str`)
        keep the random generator state (not included in the result as given
        after `endflag`)

    `phemep_balance` (:class:`dict`)
        keep the photon electron positron balance as :class:`str` indexed by
        batch number

    `homog_mat` (:class:`dict`)
        keep the homogenized material dump as :class:`str` indexed by batch
        number


    **Available methods:**

    :class:`Scanner` inherits from :class:`collections.abc.Mapping` so many
    methods are implemented or available by default: ``keys``, ``items``,
    ``values``, ``get``, ``__contains__`` (used via ``in``). ``__getitem``
    (used with ``[]``), ``__iter__`` (when iterators are required), ``__len__``
    and ``__reversed__`` are redefined.

    This class points on the :obj:`collections.OrderedDict` that it contains.
    The keys are the available batch numbers in the Tripoli-4 output, obtained
    using ``scan_obj.keys()``.
