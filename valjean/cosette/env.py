"""This module defines :class:`Env`, a class that makes it simpler to add
information about running tasks. An :class:`Env` object can be created from an
existing dictionary as follows:

    >>> from valjean.cosette.env import Env
    >>> quest = {'name': 'Sir Galahad', 'favourite colour': 'blue'}
    >>> env_quest = Env(quest)  # a shallow copy of `quest` is performed

You can use an :class:`Env` object as a glorified dicitionary (:class:`Env`
inherits from :class:`dict`), but its main purpose is really to store
information about concurrently running tasks (see :class:`~.task.Task`). By
convention, the keys in :class:`Env` are assumed to be task names; the
associated values are dictionaries storing whatever information may be useful
about the task. The dictionaries are also expected to have a ``'status'`` key
describing the current task status (see :class:`~.task.TaskStatus`). An example
of :class:`Env` respecting these conventions is the following:

    >>> from valjean.cosette.task import Task, TaskStatus
    >>> class FindHolyGrail(Task):
    ...   '''We derive a class from Task, which is abstract.'''
    ...   def do(self, env, config):
    ...     # find the Holy Grail
    ...     pass
    >>> quest = FindHolyGrail('quest')  # 'quest' is the task name
    >>> tasks = {quest.name: {'name': 'Sir Galahad',
    ...                       'favourite colour': 'blue',
    ...                       'status': TaskStatus.FAILED}}
    >>> env = Env(tasks)

The :class:`Env` API integrates well with the :mod:`~.task` module and provides
a number of practical methods for dealing with tasks. For instance, there are
``is_*`` methods for all members of the :class:`~.TaskStatus` enumeration:

    >>> env.is_failed(quest)
    True
    >>> print(env.get_status(quest))    # equivalently
    TaskStatus.FAILED

Additionally, you can change the status of a task with

    >>> env.set_status(quest, TaskStatus.DONE)
    >>> env.set_done(quest)  # equivalent, shorter version

Information about the tasks, incuding their status, is stored with the task
name as the key:

    >>> print(env[quest.name]['status'])
    TaskStatus.DONE

The :class:`Env` class tries hard to be thread-safe; that is, all its methods
will operate atomically. Internally, thread safety is enforced by locking the
object whenever its contents are accessed. This, however, does not help in case
of read-and-modify operations, as in the following example::

    >>> if env.is_done(quest):      # WARNING: do not try this at home
    ...     env.set_skipped(quest)  # race condition here!

This snippet is racy in multithreaded mode because another thread may change
the status of ``quest`` after :meth:`~.is_done()` has released the lock but
before :meth:`~.set_skipped()` has had the chance to acquire it. For these
scenarios, :class:`Env` offers the :meth:`~.atomically()` method, which accepts
as an argument the action that should be performed.  When called,
:meth:`~.atomically()` first acquires the lock on the object, and then passes
the :class:`Env` object to the action. A thread-safe implementation of the
read-and-modify trip above is implemented as follows:

    >>> def modify_task1(env):
    ...     if env.is_done(quest):
    ...         env.set_skipped(quest)
    >>> env.atomically(modify_task1)
    >>> env.is_skipped(quest)
    True
