'''This module provides classes to schedule the execution of several tasks,
possibly dependent on each other.

Example usage:

   >>> from valjean.cosette.task import DelayTask
   >>> spam = DelayTask('spam', 0.1)
   >>> eggs = DelayTask('eggs', 0.2)
   >>> bacon = DelayTask('bacon', 0.2)

   >>> from valjean.cosette.depgraph import DepGraph
   >>> g = DepGraph.from_dependency_dictionary({
   ...         spam: [],
   ...         bacon: [spam],
   ...         eggs: []
   ...     })

   >>> from valjean.cosette.scheduler import Scheduler
   >>> s = Scheduler(hard_graph=g)
   >>> env = s.schedule()  # executes the tasks in the correct order

    The Scheduler class has the responsibility of scheduling and executing a

    :mod:`~.task` for details about *hard* vs. *soft* dependencies);
    `soft_graph` is a :class:`~.depgraph.DepGraph` describing the *soft*
    dependencies alone; finally, `backend` should be an instance of a
    `*Scheduling` class such as :class:`.QueueScheduling`, or at any rate a
    class that exhibits an :meth:`~.execute_tasks()` method with the correct
    signature (see :meth:`.QueueScheduling.execute_tasks()`). If `backend` is
    `None`, the default backend will be used.
