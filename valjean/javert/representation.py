'''This module contains code that converts a test result into some kind of
human-readable representation (table, plots, etc.).

.. todo::

    Possible improvement: turn :class:`Representer` into an `ABC`; loop over
    the classes in :mod:`~.eponine` that inherit from `:class:`~.TestResult`
    and add `@abstractmethod` methods in :class:`Representer`. This way, if
    a new :class:`~.TestResult` is added to :mod:`~.eponine`, it will no longer
    be possible to instantiate any of the classes that derive from
    :class:`Representer`, pointing to the fact that the code in this module
    needs to be extended to handle the new class. This is better than silently
    falling back to some default do-nothing implementation, which may lead to
    bugs.


This module uses the `Strategy` design pattern. The :class:`Representation`
class plays the role of `Context`,  :class:`Representer` plays the role of
`Strategy` and the classes derived from :class:`Representer` (such as
:class:`TableRepresenter`, :class:`PlotRepresenter`, etc.) play the role of
`ConcreteStrategy`. See E. Gamma et al., "Design Patterns" (1995),
ISBN 0-201-63361-2, Addison-Weasley, USA.


Currently we have 3 main ``Representer`` classes:

* :class:`Representer`: parent class of all others, containing the default
  :meth:`Representer.__call__` method, calling the class method named
  ``'repr_' + class.name`` of the test;
* :class:`TableRepresenter`: inherited from :class:`Representer`,
  designed as a parent class for user's own representations of tables. Its
  :meth:`TableRepresenter.__call__` method first looks for a method called
  ``'repr_' + class.name``; if it does not exist call the default method from
  the catalogue of table representation accessible in :mod:`.table_repr`;
* :class:`PlotRepresenter`: inherited from :class:`Representer`, designed
  as a parent class for user's own representations of plots. Its
  :meth:`PlotRepresenter.__call__` method first looks for a method called
  ``'repr_' + class.name``; if it does not exist call the default method from
  the catalogue of plot representation accessible in :mod:`.plot_repr`.


An example of use of the ``Representer`` objects can be seen in the
:class:`FullTableRepresenter`. In this table representation, for the Bonferroni
test result, the input test result is first represented in a table, then the
Bonferroni itself is represented in a second table.


Thus the use of the ``Representer`` is foreseen as:

* use the default methods provided in :class:`TableRepresenter` and
  :class:`PlotRepresenter`;
* if customisation is needed, you can easily call the additional method
  available in :mod:`.table_repr` and :mod:`.plot_repr`;
* you can also write your own representation method provided they follow the
  naming convention ``'repr_' + class.name``;
* :mod:`valjean` calls the ``Representer`` classes through the
  :class:`Representation` class.
