'''This module defines a few tests that report about the success/failure status
of other tests/tasks.

Three different tests are available:

* statistics over all the tasks done, generated with :func:`task_stats`
* statistics over all the tests performed with :func:`test_stats`
* statistics over the tests performed based on labels given at test
  initialization with :func:`test_stats_by_labels`

The two tests over the test results are performed using the
:class:`~.TestResult`, so the statistics only includes the tests that were
actually run.

    '''Create a :class:`TestStatsTasks` from a list of tasks.

    The :class:`TestStatsTasks` class must be instantiated with the list of
    task results, which are not available to the user when the tests are
    specified in the job file. Therefore, the creation of the
    :class:`TestStatsTasks` must be delayed until the other tasks have finished
    and their results are available in the environment. For this purpose it is
    necessary to wrap the instantiation of :class:`TestStatsTasks` in a
    :class:`~.Use` wrapper, and evaluate the resulting test using a
    :class:`~.EvalTestTask`.

    This function hides this bit of complexity from the user. Assume you have a
    list of tasks that you would like to produce statistics about (we will use
    :class:`~.DelayTask` objects for our example):

    >>> from valjean.cosette.task import DelayTask
    >>> my_tasks = [DelayTask(1), DelayTask(3), DelayTask(0.2)]

    Here is how you make a :class:`TestStatsTasks`:

    >>> stats = task_stats(name='delays', tasks=my_tasks)
    >>> from valjean.gavroche.eval_test_task import EvalTestTask
    >>> isinstance(stats, EvalTestTask)
    True
    >>> print(stats.depends_on)
    {Task('delays.stats')}
    >>> create_stats = next(task for task in stats.depends_on)

    Here `create_stats` is the task that actually creates the
    :class:`TestStatsTasks`. It soft-depends on the tasks in `my_tasks`:

    >>> [task in create_stats.soft_depends_on for task in my_tasks]
    [True, True, True]

    The reason why the dependency is soft is that we want to collect statistics
    about the task outcome in any case, even (especially!) if some of the tasks
    failed.

    The :class:`TestStatsTests` class must be instantiated with the list of

    :class:`TestStatsTests` must be delayed until the test tasks have finished

    necessary to wrap the instantiation of :class:`TestStatsTests` in a
    :class:`~.Use` wrapper, and evaluate the resulting test using a
    :class:`~.EvalTestTask`.

    This function hides this bit of complexity from the user. Assume you have a
    list of tasks that evaluate some tests and that you would like to produce
    statistics about the tests results. Let us construct a toy dataset first:

    >>> from collections import OrderedDict
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from valjean.eponine.dataset import Dataset
    >>> x = np.linspace(-5., 5., num=100)
    >>> y = x**2
    >>> error = np.zeros_like(y)
    >>> bins = OrderedDict([('x', x)])
    >>> parabola = Dataset(y, error, bins=bins, name='parabola')
    >>> parabola2 = Dataset(y*(1+1e-6), error, bins=bins, name='parabola2')

    Now we write a function that generates dummy tests for the `parabola`
    dataset:

    >>> from valjean.gavroche.test import TestEqual, TestApproxEqual
    >>> def test_generator():
    ...     result = [TestEqual(parabola, parabola2, name='equal?').evaluate(),
    ...               TestApproxEqual(parabola, parabola2,
    ...                               name='approx_equal?').evaluate()]
    ...     return {'test_generator': {'result': result}}, TaskStatus.DONE


    We need to wrap this function in a PythonTask so that it can be executed as
    a part of the dependency graph:

    >>> from valjean.cosette.pythontask import PythonTask
    >>> create_tests_task = PythonTask('test_generator', test_generator)

    Here is how you make a :class:`TestStatsTests` to collect statistics about
    the results of the generated tests:

    >>> stats = test_stats(name='equal', tasks=[create_tests_task])

    >>> from valjean.gavroche.eval_test_task import EvalTestTask
    >>> isinstance(stats, EvalTestTask)
    True

    Here `stats` evaluates the test that gathers the statistics, and it depends
    on a special task that generates the :class:`TestStatsTests` instance:

    >>> print(stats.depends_on)
    {Task('equal.stats')}
    >>> create_stats = next(task for task in stats.depends_on)

    In turn, `create_stats` has a soft dependency on the task that generates
    our test, `create_tests_task`:

    >>> create_tests_task in create_stats.soft_depends_on
    True

    The reason why the dependency is soft is that we want to collect statistics
    about the test outcome in any case, even (especially!) if some of the tests
    failed or threw exceptions.

    Let's run the tests:

    >>> from valjean.config import Config
    >>> config = Config()
    >>> from valjean.cosette.env import Env
    >>> env = Env()
    >>> for task in [create_tests_task, create_stats, stats]:
    ...     env_up, status = task.do(env=env, config=config)
    ...     env.apply(env_up)
    >>> print(status)
    TaskStatus.DONE

    The results are stored in a :class:`list` under the key ``'result'``:

    >>> print(len(env[stats.name]['result']))
    1
    >>> stats_res = env[stats.name]['result'][0]
    >>> print("SUCCESS:", stats_res.classify[TestOutcome.SUCCESS])

    '''Create a :class:`TestStatsTestsByLabels` from a list of tests.

    See :func:`test_stats` for the generalities about this function.

    Compared to :func:`test_stats` it takes one argument more: ``'by_labels'``
    to classify then build statistics based on these labels. **The order of the
    labels matters**, as they are successively selected.

    Let's define three menus:

    >>> menu1 = {'food': 'egg + spam', 'drink': 'beer'}
    >>> menu2 = {'food': 'egg + bacon', 'drink': 'beer'}
    >>> menu3 = {'food': 'lobster thermidor', 'drink': 'brandy'}

    These three menus are ordered by pairs. Statistics on meals are
    kept in the restaurant, using :class:`~.TestMetadata`. The goal of the
    tests is to know if both persons of a pair order the same menu and when
    they do it.

    .. code::

        orders = [TestMetadata(
            {'Graham': menu1, 'Terry': menu1}, name='gt_wday_lunch',
            labels={'day': 'Wednesday', 'meal': 'lunch'}),
                  TestMetadata(
            {'Michael': menu1, 'Eric': menu2}, name='me_wday_dinner',
            labels={'day': 'Wednesday', 'meal': 'dinner'}),
                  TestMetadata(
            {'John': menu2, 'Terry': menu2}, name='jt_wday',
            labels={'day': 'Wednesday'}),
                  TestMetadata(
            {'Terry': menu3, 'John': menu3}, name='Xmasday',
            labels={'day': "Christmas Eve"})]

    The restaurant owner uses :func:`test_stats_by_labels` to build statistics
    on his menus and the habits of his consumers.

    For example, the menus filtered on ``day`` will give:

    .. code::

        =============  ============  =============
              day       % success      % failure
        =============  ============  =============
        Christmas Eve      1/1            0/1
            Wednesday      2/3            1/3
        =============  ============  =============

    These results means, considering the tests requested, both consumers have
    the same meal on Christmas Eve. On Wednesday, one pair of customers out of
    three did not order the same menu.

    The same kind of statistics can be done based on the meal:

    .. code::

        ==========  ============  =============
           meal       % success     % failure
        ==========  ============  =============
          dinner         0/1            1/1
           lunch         1/1            0/1
        ==========  ============  =============

    In that case two tests were not taken into account as they did not have any
    ``'meal'`` label.

    It is also possible to make selections on multiple labels. In that case the
    order matters: the classification is performed following the order of the
    labels requested. For example, ``'meal'`` then ``'day'`` :

    .. code::

        ==========  =========  ============  =============
           meal        day       % success     % failure
        ==========  =========  ============  =============
          dinner    Wednesday       0/1            1/1
           lunch    Wednesday       1/1            0/1
        ==========  =========  ============  =============

    * Only two tests are filtered due to the meal selection
    * Requesting ``'day'`` then ``'meal'`` would only inverse the two first
      columns in that case and emit a **warning**: a preselection on ``'day'``
      is done and in Christmas Eve case the ``'meal'`` label is not provided,
      the selection cannot be done. In the Wednesday one, no problem ``'meal'``
      appears at least in one case (two in our cases).

    Finally if the request involves a label that does not exist in any test an
    exception will be raised, mentioning the failing label.
