In Student's t-test, we consider 2 different datasets that can have different
means and different variances. The main problem is to test if the means are
equal.  One way to do that is to use Student's t-test, although technically
this name should be reserved for the case where the variances are unknown but
they are known to be equal (the generalized version to different variances is
called Welch's test).

In Tripoli-4, like in most Monte Carlo codes, the estimated statistical
uncertainty is the standard error, i.e. the standard deviation of the mean of
the samples. It is typically assumed that the distribution of the mean is
normal, as a consequence of the central limit theorem. The variance of the
population is estimated as

.. math::

    s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2

and the variance of the mean is estimated as

.. math::

    \bar{s}^2 = \frac{s^2}{n}

The standard error :math:`\bar{s}` is the quantity that typically enters
Student's t-test.

The Student test statistic is:

.. math::

    t_{\text{Student}} = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}
    {\sqrt{\bar{s}_1^2 + \bar{s}_2^2}}


Note that, with our :class:`~valjean.eponine.dataset.Dataset`, this is
equivalent to

.. code::

    diff = dataset_1 - dataset_2
    t(Student) = diff.value / diff.error

as value is difference of values and error is equal to the quadratic sum of the
errors.


Test interpretation
```````````````````

The tested hypothesis in the Student's t-test, i.e. the null hypothesis is:

* equal means, so :math:`m_1 = m_2`
* Gaussian errors (or error following a normal distribution)
* independent datasets.

The test interpretation is based on the comparison of the p-value with a given
significance level, called :math:`\alpha`. The (two-sided) p-value is defined
as the probability to observe results more extreme than those that were
actually observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Mathematically,
:math:`p=P(|X| \geq |t_{\text{Student}}|\,|N)`, :math:`X` being the Student
test statistic for samples of size :math:`N`; the variable :math:`N` is also
called the number of degrees of freedom.  The significativity level
:math:`\alpha` is given by the user, usually 1% or 5%.  Student's test fails if
:math:`P(|X| \geq |t_{\text{Student}}|) \leq \alpha`. If this is the case the
null hypothesis is rejected.

To evaluate the test we thus need an estimate of the number of degrees of
freedom, which is typically approximated as :math:`n_1 + n_2 - 2`, with
:math:`n_1` and :math:`n_2` being the number of batches. For large values of
:math:`n_i` (i.e. for a large number of degrees of freedom), the distribution
of the Student statistic approaches a standard normal distribution.

It is sometimes easier to evaluate if the test succeeds by directly comparing
the value of :math:`t_{\text{Student}}` with a threshold given by the
significativity level :math:`\alpha` and the number of degrees of freedom.

For example, here are some thresholds for some values of :math:`\alpha` and of
the number of degrees of freedom:

.. |inf| replace:: :math:`\infty`

+------------+----------------------+----------------------+
|            | :math:`\alpha` = 1 % | :math:`\alpha` = 5 % |
+------------+----------------------+----------------------+
|  N = 10    |        2.7638        |        1.8125        |
+------------+----------------------+----------------------+
|  N = 1000  |        2.5807        |        1.9623        |
+------------+----------------------+----------------------+
|  N = |inf| |        2.5758        |        1.9600        |
+------------+----------------------+----------------------+

Results for N = |inf| come from the normal distribution.


.. note::

    This test can also be used on histograms (spectrum, mesh). In this case, an
    independent test is made for each bin. The test for the whole histogram
    succeeds if *all* the individual tests succeed.  A better option is to use
    a Bonferroni or a Holm-Bonferroni test (see the :mod:`~.bonferroni`
    module).

Code implementation
```````````````````

If the number of degrees of freedom is given, p-values are estimated using
Student's t-distribution. If the number is not given or it is `None`, it is
assumed that it is very large and the normal approximation is used.

The p-value is only calculated if the number of degrees of freedom is given;
otherwise, the Student result is just compared to the threshold. To test the
p-value instead of the value of the t-statistic, use
:func:`TestResultStudent.test_pvalue`.

All these methods use the **SciPy** package (see `scipy`_). The Student
distribution comes from :obj:`scipy.stats.t`, where the pdf is explicitely
written.

The method ``sf`` of :obj:`scipy.stats.t` corresponds to :math:`1 - cdf`, so
this gives the one-sided p-value; we need to multiply it by 2.0 to get the
two-sided p-value. The ``ppf`` (percent point) function returns the threshold
corresponding to the required one-sided significativity, so we need to divide
:math:`\alpha` by 2.0 in our case.

The methods where the test is really applied are static methods, they can be
used outside of the :class:`TestStudent` class. Examples are given in the class
docstrings.


Examples
````````

Let's get an example: one simulation gave 5.3 ± 0.2, the other one 5.25 ± 0.08.
Are these numbers in agreement ?

>>> from valjean.eponine.dataset import Dataset
>>> from valjean.gavroche.stat_tests.student import TestStudent
>>> import numpy as np
>>> ds1 = Dataset(5.3, 0.2)
>>> ds2 = Dataset(5.25, 0.08)
>>> tstudent = TestStudent(ds1, ds2, name="comp",
...                        description="Comparison using Student's t-test")
>>> tstudent_res = tstudent.evaluate()
>>> print(f'{tstudent_res.tstud[0]:.7f}')
0.2321192
>>> print(f'{tstudent_res.test.threshold:.7f}')
2.5758293
>>> bool(tstudent_res)
True

To obtain the p-value, a number of degrees of freedom should be given:

>>> tstudent = TestStudent(ds1, ds2, ndf=1000, name="comp",
...                        description="Comparison using Student's t- test")
>>> tstudent_res = tstudent.evaluate()
>>> print(f'{tstudent_res.tstud[0]:.7f}')
0.2321192
>>> print(f'{tstudent_res.test.threshold:.7f}')
2.5807547
>>> bool(tstudent_res)
True
>>> print(f'{tstudent_res.pvalue[0]:.7f}')
0.8164929
>>> tstudent_res.test_pvalue()
[True]


This is also possible if we want to compare a bin to bin different spectra.
Let's define 2 small datasets containing arrays:

>>> ds3 = Dataset(np.array([5.2, 5.3, 5.25, 5.4, 5.5]),
...               np.array([0.2, 0.25, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3]))
>>> ds4 = Dataset(np.array([5.1, 5.6, 5.2, 5.3, 5.2]),
...               np.array([0.1, 0.3, 0.05, 0.4, 0.3]))
>>> tstudent = TestStudent(ds3, ds4, name="comp",
...                        description="Comparison using Student's t-test")
>>> tstudent_res = tstudent.evaluate()
>>> print(np.array2string(tstudent_res.oracles()))
[[ True  True  True  True  True]]
>>> bool(tstudent_res)
True

In the case of multiple comparisons, the test will return `True` if *all* the
individual comparisons succeed. This is the case here.

It is possible to get a detailed bin-by-bin comparisons, including bad bins:

>>> ds5 = Dataset(np.array([5.1, 5.9, 5.8, 5.3, 4.5]),
...               np.array([0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.4, 0.1]))
>>> tstudent = TestStudent(ds3, ds5, name="comp",
...                        description="Comparison using Student's t-test")
>>> tstudent_res = tstudent.evaluate()
>>> print(f'{tstudent_res.test.threshold:.7f}')
2.5758293
>>> print(np.array2string(tstudent_res.oracles()))
[[ True  True False  True False]]

Since some of the comparisons failed here, the whole tests fails as well:

>>> bool(tstudent_res)
False

As in the scalar case, it is possible to ask for the p-values. In both cases
the significativity can be changed via the ``alpha`` argument, as shown here:

>>> tstudent = TestStudent(ds3, ds5, name="comp", alpha=0.05, ndf=1000,
...                        description="Comparison using Student's t-test")
>>> tstudent_res = tstudent.evaluate()
>>> print(f'{tstudent_res.test.threshold:.7f}')
1.9623391
>>> print(np.array2string(tstudent_res.oracles()))
[[ True False False  True False]]
>>> print(f'{tstudent_res.tstud[0][1]:.7f}')
-2.2283441

This last value is in-between the thresholds at 1% and 5%, in magnitude, and
therefore the test succeeds in the former case and fails in the latter.

Obtaining p-values and comparing them is also possible in the spectrum case:

>>> print(np.array2string(tstudent_res.pvalue[0],
...                       formatter={'float_kind':'{:.7e}'.format}))
[6.5481769e-01 2.6079281e-02 1.0147751e-06 8.2310894e-01 1.6125524e-03]
>>> print(np.array2string(tstudent_res.test_pvalue()[0]))
[ True False False  True False]

Finally, for an array of size 1 (and dimension 1), the test will do the same as
for datasets containing :obj:`numpy.generic`:

>>> ds6 = Dataset(np.array([5.3]), np.array([0.2]))
>>> ds7 = Dataset(np.array([5.25]), np.array([0.08]))
>>> tstudent = TestStudent(ds6, ds7, name="comp",
...                        description="Comparison using Student's t-test")
>>> tstudent_res = tstudent.evaluate()
>>> print(np.array2string(tstudent_res.tstud[0],
...                       formatter={'float_kind':'{:.7f}'.format}))
[0.2321192]
>>> print(f'{tstudent_res.test.threshold:.7f}')
2.5758293
>>> bool(tstudent_res)
True

Like for usual operations on datasets, only tests between datasets of the same
shape are possible:

>>> tstudent = TestStudent(ds1, ds7, name="comp",
...                        description="Comparison using Student's t-test")
>>> tstudent_res = tstudent.evaluate()
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
ValueError: Datasets to subtract do not have same shape

Multi-dimensional datasets are also allowed:

>>> ds8 = Dataset(np.array([[5.2, 5.3, 5.25], [5.4, 5.5, 5.2]]),
...               np.array([[0.2, 0.25, 0.1], [0.2, 0.3, 0.1]]))
>>> ds9 = Dataset(np.array([[5.1, 5.6, 5.2], [5.3, 5.2, 5.3]]),
...               np.array([[0.1, 0.3, 0.05], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2]]))
>>> ds8.shape
(2, 3)
>>> ds8.size
6
>>> tstudent = TestStudent(ds8, ds9, alpha=0.05, ndf=1000, name="comp",
...                        description="Comparison using Student's t-test")
>>> tstudent_res = tstudent.evaluate()
>>> bool(tstudent_res)
True
>>> print(np.array2string(tstudent_res.tstud[0],
...                       formatter={'float_kind':'{:.7f}'.format}))
[[0.4472136 -0.7682213 0.4472136]
 [0.2236068 0.7071068 -0.4472136]]
>>> print(np.array2string(tstudent_res.oracles()))
[[[ True  True  True]
  [ True  True  True]]]


.. warning::
    If the errors are equal to 0, so the Student denominator is 0, AND the
    values are equal, so the numerator is also 0, the Student value is set to
    0. In that case the test is assumed to succeed (boolean returning `True`).

    >>> ds10 = Dataset(np.array([3.2, 0, 5]), np.array([0, 0.5, 0]))
    >>> ds11 = Dataset(np.array([3.2, 0, 5.2]), np.array([0, 0.5, 0]))
    >>> tstudent = TestStudent(ds10, ds11, name='zeros')
    >>> tstudent_res = tstudent.evaluate()
    >>> bool(tstudent_res)
    False
    >>> print(np.array2string(tstudent_res.tstud[0]))
    [  0.   0. -inf]
    >>> print(np.array2string(tstudent_res.oracles()))

        Student distribution corresponding to ``ndf``.  If not, we consider an
        infinite number of degrees of freedom.  In that case, the Student
        distribution tends to a normal distribution.
