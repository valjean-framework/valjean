What is valjean?
================

:mod:`valjean` is a framework for building test suites for scientific
computing. It can help with the automation of most of the steps of a typical
test suite, including checkout and compilation of the source code, execution of
calculations, post-processing of calculations results, hypothesis testing and
generation of test reports.

:mod:`valjean` is developed by the French Alternative Energies and Atomic
Energy Commission (CEA) as a tool for the verification and validation (V&V)
suite of the `TRIPOLI-4®`_ Monte-Carlo particle-transport code. It includes a
parser for TRIPOLI-4 calculation results, but its aim is to be more broadly
useful to the whole community of scientific computing.
