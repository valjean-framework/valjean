Examples (in French)
====================

Notebooks
---------

.. only:: not notebooks

   .. note::

     The example notebooks were not converted to HTML because the ``notebooks``
     tag was not defined.  Pass ``-t notebooks`` to ``sphinx-build`` to convert
     notebooks to HTML (requires the ``pandoc`` executable).
