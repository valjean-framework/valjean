Examples (in French)
====================

Notebooks
---------

.. only:: no_notebooks

   .. note::

     The example notebooks were not converted to HTML because the
     ``no_notebooks`` tag was defined.  Do not pass ``-t no_notebooks`` to
     ``sphinx-build`` to activate the conversion of notebooks to HTML (requires
     the ``pandoc`` executable).
